Project 1:
Road fatalities

Does Socioeconomic status impact number of fatal collisions?

- Gathered data from 5 major cities (Toronto, NY, Boston, Montreal, Vancouver)

- Datasets include: fatal collision data (from municipal polic departments), median income data (from city wide census)

- Pandas: clean, remove outliers, organize and sort through data set to create final summaries for each city. Each city was then merged to be compared.

- Matplotlib: Create scatter plots, with linear regression to plot correlation in individual cities. See if each city follows same trend. Then with the merged dataset create a final scatter plot with each city in individual colour.

- Scatter plots are median income compared to collision count (grouped by neighbourhood in which they occur)

- Additional scatter plot created for Toronto to investigate impact of pedestrian fatalities in each neighbourhood

- API: use google to visualize where accidents occur most frequently
